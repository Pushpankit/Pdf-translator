# Pdf-translator

## Project Overview

This Python-based project allows users to extract text from PDF files and translate it into a desired language using the Google Translate API. It reads the PDF, extracts the content, and provides a translated version in the selected language. The program aims to automate text translation from a document format to make the information more accessible in different languages.

## Features

- **PDF Text Extraction**: Extracts text from PDF files using the PyPDF2 library.
- **Language Translation**: Translates extracted text using the `googletrans` library.
- **Language Support**: Supports translation between various languages, including Hindi, English, Spanish, and more.
- **User Input**: Users can specify the input file and the target language for translation.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages in case of issues like file permission errors or invalid translations.

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- **PyPDF2**: Used to extract text from PDF files.
- **googletrans**: Used to translate extracted text into the target language.

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2 googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project files.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter the path to the PDF file, source language code, and destination language code. The translated text will be displayed in the terminal.

## Example Usage

```bash
Enter the path of the PDF file: /path/to/file.pdf
Enter source language code (or 'auto' for auto-detect): en
Enter destination language code: hi
```

The program will display the extracted text and its translation in Hindi.

## Project Structure

```bash
/project-directory
    /main.py                # Main Python script for text extraction and translation
    /requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
